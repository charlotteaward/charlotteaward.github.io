	<h2>Wide-field time-domain survey science: methodologies and applications</h2>
	<p>I develop image forward modeling techniques that combine multi-resolution imaging data for a variety of 'static' and time-domain science cases in preparation for the Legacy Survey of Space Time at <a href="https://rubinobservatory.org/">Rubin Observatory</a> and the <a href="https://www.euclid-ec.org/">Euclid</a> and <a href="https://roman.gsfc.nasa.gov/">Roman</a> space telescopes. I am currently contributing to <a href="https://github.com/pmelchior/scarlet2">Scarlet2</a>, a new version of the <a href="https://pmelchior.github.io/scarlet/">Scarlet</a> multi-resolution scene modeling and deblending code for astronomical imaging data. Scarlet2 is written in jax for GPU-compatibility, <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2213133724000908?via%3Dihub">implements data-driven neural network priors on galaxy morphologies</a> to improve models of blended and low S/N galaxies, and uses <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213133725000034?via%3Dihub">constraints on variable vs static sources to deblend transients from their host galaxies in multi-epoch imaging.</a> We are using this software to <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17661">confirm tidal disruption events from wandering black holes</a>, model strongly lensed supernovae (in prep), and identify optical counterparts to radio pulsars (in prep).</p>

	<p> My previous work with <a href="https://www.ztf.caltech.edu/">ZTF</a> included using multi-resolution forward modeling to detect <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abf246">AGN spatially offset from their host galaxies</a>, and to localize <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/abde34">TDEs</a>, <a href ="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab6a1b">optical counterparts to GW sources</a>, and <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2041-8213/ab8cc7">fast blue optical transients</a>. I implemented a difference imaging pipeline for the <a href ="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ac8666">detection of variable dwarf galaxy AGN</a> in ZTF which cannot be identified by classical spectroscopic methods. In the early days of ZTF, I helped develop the initial <a href ="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1538-3873/aaf3fa">real-bogus machine learning classifier</a> for transient alerts and the alert filtering pipeline for the ZTF black holes working group using <a href ="https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/full_html/2019/11/aa35634-19/aa35634-19.html">the AMPEL alert broker</a>. </p> 
	

	<h2>Supermassive black hole accretion: disk-emitters, changing-state AGN, and TDEs</h2>
	
	<p>I am interested in understanding the structure and evolution of AGN accretion disks, particularly in cases where a new disk has formed due to a tidal disruption event or the triggering of a new accretion episode in a previously quiescent AGN. My recent <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ad147d">paper</a> on ZTF AGN with 'double-peaked' broad lines from accretion disk emission showed that a large fraction of variable AGN have visible and evolving accretion disks. The broad-line evolution of the 'disk-emitting' AGN in ZTF is quite different to that observed from <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.20408.pdf">AGN during the onset of an accretion episode</a> and <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/ab24de">disk-emitting tidal disruption events</a>, which show more complex evolution. I have previously contributed to the detection and spectroscopic follow-up of the <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/aca283">ZTF TDE sample</a> as well as <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/1538-4357/acfb84">analysis of their host galaxies</a>. I am currently working on a multi-wavelength population study of spectroscopically identified 'changing-state AGN', using the <a href="https://science.nrao.edu/vlass">VLASS</a> and <a href="https://www.vast-survey.org/">VAST</a> time-domain radio surveys. </p>
