        <h1>Outreach, EDI and Mentoring</h1>
	<p> I have been involved in a number of local outreach and EDI initiatives at Princeton as co-coordinator (and regular volunteer): </p>
	  <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://www.astro.princeton.edu/observatory/publicobserving.php">Public observing events</a> at the Peyton Telescope</li>
          <li> <a href="https://www.facebook.com/aottrenton/">Astronomy on Tap, Trenton Chapter</a> monthly events</li>
          <li>The Physics and Astrophysics EDI seminar series as part of the <a href="https://phy.princeton.edu/edi-initiative">Princeton Physics EDI Initiative</a></li>
        </ul>
	<p>Within the department, I am also a mentor for the postdoc--grad student mentoring program, and a regular host for the <a href="https://web.astro.princeton.edu/events/astro-coffeeprinceton">Princeton Astrocoffee</a> daily arXiv journal club. </p>

	<p> While a PhD student at University of Maryland, I was co-lead, research mentor, python bootcamp developer and visiting speaker for the <a href="https://www.umdgradmap.org/">GRAD-MAP</a> program. As co-lead I coordinated visits to local community colleges and HBCUs, and organized the Winter Workshop and Summer Scholars research programs, which included Python tutorials, visits to labs and telescopes, and research projects. I was also co-coordinator of the weekly grad student Journal Club at UMD.</p>
	
	<p> I have been a research advisor for undergraduate students through the <a href="https://web.astro.princeton.edu/academic/undergraduate-summer-research-program-usrp">Undergraduate Summer Research Program</a> (USRP) at Princeton and the <a href="https://www.umdgradmap.org/winter-workshop-1">GRAD-MAP Winter Workshop</a> at UMD. I am currently advising three undergraduate students for junior thesis projects as well as continuing work from summer projects. I am also collaborating with some fantastic grad students from Princeton and elsewhere.
